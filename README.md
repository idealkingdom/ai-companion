# 🤖 AI Companion for VS Code

> **Your Pair Programmer, but cooler.**

Welcome to **AI Companion**, the VS Code extension that turns your editor into a powerhouse of productivity. Whether you need a quick snippet refactor or an entire architectural overhaul, we've got you covered.

## ✨ Features That Shine

### 1. 🧠 Smart Chat Interaction
Don't just code; *converse*.
*   **Context Aware**: Knows your active file and selected code.
*   **Dual-Brain Power**: Compatible with **OpenAI** (GPT-5,GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 and o1 family) and **Google Gemini** (3 belows. Pro, Flash).
*   **Premium UI**: A sleek, dark-mode-first design with glassmorphism that feels right at home in VS Code.

### 2. 👁️ Vision Support
Drag, drop, done.
*   Upload UI mockups or bug screenshots directly into the chat.
*   The AI uses state-of-the-art Vision models to analyze your images and generate code.

### 3. ⛓️ Prompt Chains ("The Recipes")
Stop repeating yourself.
*   Define a sequence of specialized agents (e.g., *1. Architect* -> *2. Programmer* -> *3. Critic*).
*   One click runs your code through the entire assembly line.
*   **Perfect for:** Generating docs, writing detailed tests, or layered refactoring.

### 4. ⚙️ God-Mode Settings UI
Control everything.
*   **Dynamic Model Fetching**: Automatically pulls the latest models from your API provider. No more hardcoded lists.
*   **Visual Logic**: "Eye-friendly" toggles (glowing text effects!) and clean dropdowns.
*   **Secure**: Your API keys are stored safely in VS Code's encrypted secret storage.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap: Agentic Mode ("The Chef")
*Coming Soon™*

We are moving beyond simple "Recipes" to a fully autonomous "Chef".
*   **The Difference**:
    *   **Prompt Chains (Current)**: Linear instructions ("Add salt, then stir").
    *   **Agentic Mode (Future)**: Autonomous reasoning ("This tastes bland, what does it need? Ah, salt!").
*   **Tools**: The Agent will have access to file reading, terminal commands, and web search to *actually do the work*, not just talk about it.
